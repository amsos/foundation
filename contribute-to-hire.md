# Contribute-to-Hire

At Govrn, we like to treat everyone [like a contributor](/handbook/how-to-contribute.md#). If people rise or fall to the level you treat them, we think being a contributor is the pinnacle.

As a result, we want to pull anyone we hire to our core team from those already contributing to Govrn.

## Why do we like contributors so much?

Why do we like contributors so much? We think that they have the best insight for on the ground decisions. We as a core team might have ideas on things to build or initiatives to run, but if no contributors want to work on it with us, that's a pretty good signal that it's not important to work on.

Additinally, by having core team members start as contributors, we're able to reduce old paradigm barriers for hire. We don't have to put so much improtance on a "resume" as anyone can showcase their skills by just contributing. The coolest part is that the contributor is getting paid for their contributions too. We're essentially paying for you to interview!

## How does contribute-to-hire work?

It's worth mentioning that the goal of contribute to hire is to eventually hire you onto the Govrn core team. **This won't be the pipeline for all contributors, but rather for those that want to join the core team.** This highlights another benefit of Contribute-to-Hire as it allows the contributor to test out if they enjoy working with Govrn before being hired!

## The Process

First, start by making a contribution. The easiest way to do this is to check out our Issues in this repo. There we highlight all the different open contribution opportunities for you to jump on.

Once you find an issue to contribute to, you can take a look at our Govrn Movement Model to see the best way to actually contribute to those issues! Most issues will have a suggestion on individual tasks

After you've started to making continous contributions, and you are still interested in being hired to core, DM one Aaron and let him know of your interest. From there we will start discussions on how to eventually be hired.

Our goal is to have this process to last between 1-3 months.

## Benefits of being Core vs Contributor

It's not necesarilly better to be a Govrn Core Member vs being a Govrn Contributor. Both can earn you a sustainable living.

The main difference is the level of control/moderation you'll have in respect to different projects. Some decisions and projects require long term commitments and high level of trust.

That said, being a **core doesn't just mean you commit to Govrn, but that Govrn commits to you.** As a Core Member, you receive a more standardized and regular form of compensation. Additionally, thier are less restrictions on the goals of your work.

## End Vision

In our utopia, we think that Govrn could be run totally by contributors. We think there is no better way to ensure we serve our community by being run purely by contributors.

But we think that this end goal is still a ways off. There are many processes to test and understand, both formal and social. Our goal is to work towards that over time.
