  1. **Use short sentences.** Ideally, sentences should have fewer than 15 words. This improves clarity. The Hemingway Editor helps achieve this.
  2. **Cut common phrases.** E.g. replace "due to the fact" with "because."
  3. **Take a stance.** It's easier to agree or disagree with a stance, even if it's just based on a hunch. Ambigious opinions fizzle out. If you don't have an opnion, say so.
  4. **Back the Stance.** Give two sentences on your reasoning. Data is preffered, but hunches and intuition works in a pinch.
  5. **Eliminate ambiguous words.** Actively avoid words which weaken your point (e.g. "nearly" instead of an exact percentage)
  6. Use the "So What?" test. Before sending a communique, re-read and ask "So, what?" Does your content provide value? Will your audience understand? Are you sharing enough context?
  7. **Avoid adverbs.** If you spot an adverb, remove it. E.g. replace "massive increase" with "300 new subscribers."
  8. **Be objective.** Objectivity injects confidence. E.g. "replace "I think this change is working" with "our new approach led to a 5% increase."
  9. **Cut acronyms and jargon.** Aim to explain to a child. E.g. do not assume that someone understands what MR means. Instead, write out "merge request."
  10. **Use Subject-Verb-Object sentences.** Follow this path when constructing sentences: Who/what are you writing about? ⮕ What did they do? ⮕ What was acted on?
