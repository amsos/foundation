# Cultural Customs

### Why? What are these?

Every community, every group, every movement has cultural customs. Everyone from community gatherings for coffee, saying hello or good morning, mid day prayers, end of day drinks, or even a mid day nap.

These customs, these practices allow us to build processes of work around. We start with our "life" customs and build our "work life" around that.

- If you know you're taking a midday nap, you need to make your coworkers aware that you won't be online from 2-4 pm.
- If you don't spend time working Friday night to Saturday night, we need to update our team with the progress from the previous week before we log off.
- If mornings give you energy, saying good morning to your team when you first show up is important.

We wanted to create a set of customs for the Govrn Community to interact with each other and the lifes we want.

## The Customs

1. Say good morning | Daily
   - To start each others day with a smile
2. Where are you working from | When you're in a new location
   - So that we can support each other in their adventure
3. Your working hours | Beginning of the Week
   - So that we can all live in the present, not live for the workday.
   - Because it's work should be a part of your life, not your life being a part of your work.
4. Good night | Daily
   - So others know when your brain needs to relax
5. Status Update | End of Week
   - So that no one feels anxious
